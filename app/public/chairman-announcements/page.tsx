Hello Kenyan Family. 

Our community thrives when we invest in the next generation - our Youth. 

Communities from other Countries are  doing very well in mentoring and guiding their youth to be the future leaders of this Country.

We can do the same for our youth. 

Very often, children don't take the words of advise from their parents, but  they quite often heed the words of counsel from someone else.

Let us begin the journey of guiding our youth, as a Community so that we can lay the foundations of their future sucess.

In this regard, we are organizing a Kenyan Youth Meet-Up Event, where they can have fun together, and we can then engage them in discussions - about career planning, mental health, drugs and addictions, substance abuse, being financially smart, the importance of belonging to a successful community, among other relevant topics.

We can also get some of our youth, to assist in arranging for the event, so that they have ownership.

As well, we can have some of our young adults talk to the youth as well, so they can see themselves in the ones talking to them. 

The date of the event is set for the last Saturday of this month, on AUGUST 30th for ALL Kenyan youth in their early teens to mid twenties (Around 13 - 25 years old). 

Please Reserve the date for your Children. 

We thank the KCA Leadership for being a part of this initiative. 

More details to follow.

Thank you so much  üôèüèæ
