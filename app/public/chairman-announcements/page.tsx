        <p>Hello Kenyan Family,</p>

        <p>
          Our community thrives when we invest in the next generation—our Youth. Communities from other countries are doing very well in mentoring and guiding their youth to become future leaders of this country. We can do the same for ours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Very often, children don't take the words of advice from their parents, but they do heed the counsel of others. Let us begin the journey of guiding our youth as a community, so we can lay the foundations of their future success.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this regard, we are organizing a <strong>Kenyan Youth Meet-Up Event</strong>, where they can have fun together and engage in meaningful discussions—about career planning, mental health, drugs and addictions, substance abuse, financial literacy, and the importance of belonging to a successful community.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also plan to involve some of our youth in organizing the event, giving them a sense of ownership. Additionally, we’ll invite young adults to speak to the youth, so they can see themselves reflected in those sharing their experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, August 30th<br />
          <strong>Audience:</strong> Kenyan youth aged 13–25
        </p>

        <p>
          Please reserve the date for your children. We thank the KCA Leadership for being part of this initiative. More details to follow.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">Sincerely,<br />Your Chairman</p>
        <p className="text-2xl">🙏🏾</p>
