        Genesis of the association is the common principle in our homeland culture that <strong>"No one should mourn alone."</strong>

      <p>
        As Kenyans moving to the diaspora, we find ourselves in a different environment, yet our traditions regarding bereavement remain unchanged. The peace and stability of our families in the diaspora are impacted by bereavement in several ways:

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800">Timing Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          In the diaspora, our work lives are based on schedules, which can be fixed at any time, 24/7, depending on our jobs and employers. This contrasts with life back home, where the day begins at 8:00 am and ends at 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday. Therefore, bringing people together for a common cause in Kenya often takes place in the evenings and on weekends. In the diaspora, it is always a challenge to gather many Kenyans at the same time, even when they live in the same city.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800">Community Support</h3>
        <p>
          In Kenya, bereavement is considered a community issue where family and neighbors spontaneously gather to support the affected family financially and with prayers. In the Americas, bereavements are usually covered through insurance and are generally treated as a family-by-family affair.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800">Support in Calgary</h3>
        <p>
          Kenyans in Calgary are expected to support each other as family when tragedy strikes, just as we do back home. In the event of a death within our community, we may assist with cremation or the repatriation of the deceased's body to Kenya. If a close family member passes away in Kenya, the bereaved family member usually travels to be with the rest of the family. Either way, financial support is required. Mobilizing money for travel and other expenses at short notice is not easy.

      <p>
        It is for these and other reasons that a group of visionary Kenyans, led by <strong>Mr. Dan Mugo</strong>, <strong>Wycliffe Oduor</strong>, and <strong>Sister Njeri</strong>, established the Marafiki Support Group (MSG). This idea evolved into an organization with a Founders Board and a Constitutionâ€”and the rest is history.
